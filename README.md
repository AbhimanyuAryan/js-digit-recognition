# JS Digit Recognition

My attempt to write a digit recognition engine in JavaScript (TypeScript to be precise). This tool utilises some very basic concepts behind neural networks.

# Data set

As my data set I'm using [USPS Handwritten Digits](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/usps_all.mat) (also found as jpeg in the `raw_data` folder). I do appreciate the fact that it is a **very** small data set but in my opinion it will suffice for this simple exercise.
